Originator: Andrew Chin, andrewthomchin@gmail.com
Start date: 2021-06-09
Objectives:
  - contextualize fisheries in the Northern Pacific to support BECI proposal
    - visualize catch/CPUE from priority NPFC species
      - contextualize NPFC fisheries, especially Pacific saury, with effort and proceedings from NPFC meetings
    - visualize Pacific cod catch

  - 'README.md'
  - 'NPFC_data_READ.ME.txt'
  - moved 'rmd' folder to 'output\rmd'

Brief:

Summary:
  - updated the README detailing what the different folders are for how they work
  - w/ Caroline: went over status of the repo and decided to post a link to the repo at "~\NORTH PACIFIC ANADROMOUS FISH COMMI\Secretariat - Documents\Decade of the Ocean\Plots"
  - pushed to public GitHub

Breadcrumbs:
  - create scripts + plots for Pacific cod

Brief:
  - cleaning up!

Summary:
  - removed CPUE from the catch.Rmd,  but retained in the report.Rmd
  - removed the *2020 prefix from the pacific cod catch files
  - ran 'NPFC catch data.Rmd' and made sure everything is clear

Breadcrumbs:
  - plot cod? if I have time...
    - need to convert the numbers into numeric
  - leave READ.ME for description of all scripts in the folder

    - neon and japanese flying squid catch plots

Files edited:
  - 'report.Rmd'
    - RENAMED: 'Pacificsauryreport_Jun252021.Rmd'
  - 'NPFC catch data.Rmd'

Summary:
  - showed plots to Mark - got a seal of approval
  - plot just squid
  - included NPFC convention map

Breadcrumbs:
  - do a bit more reading into SSC-06 report [NULL]
  - more research into overlap between salmon and saury? [NULL]
  - figure out what the temperature envelopes that salmon and saury prefer in the NPac
  - pull out catch and abundance stats for Pcod from most recent AFSC stock asssessment and catch statistics

Files created:
  - 'report.Rmd'
  - CPUE figures

Brief:
  - report writing time in RMarkdown

Summary:
  - started writing up short report for Mark. Learning some of the basics of RMarkdown!
  - plotted up the CPUE used in stock assessment models
  - gotten most of the LH, dist, etc. information down

Breadcrumbs:
  - **include NPFC convention area map

  - 'NPFC_CPUE_saury_allcountries.pdf'
    - saury CPUE by vessel for all countries
  - 'NPFC_saury_CPUE_2019_stock_assessment_June182021.csv'

Brief:
  - CPUE

Summary:
  - calculated saury CPUE into a plot
  - couldn't find how CPUE was calculated, but the stock assessments have detailed F and BMSY plots and base-case scenarios
  - found the CPUE used for the stock assessment models from 1980-2019

Breadcrumbs:
  - plot the stock assessment CPUE as a scatter/line plot
  - read through the SSC-06 report, since I think it is the most relevant and paper so far
  - create a short data summary of saury distribution, NPFC fisheries, and overlap with Zone 1  of the Expedition

  - 'NPFC_catch_allspecies_NWvCA.pdf'
  - 'NPFC_catch_saury_NWvCA.pdf'

Brief:
  - comparisons between National Waters and Convention Area for all species
  - notes!

Summary:
  - working from a basic plot and adding/removing elements for customized plotting
  - created plots for
    - National Waters v Convention Area for saury & all species
    - catch within CA for saury and all species, by country
  - started taking Notion notes of saury LH, popdy

Breadcrumbs:
  - calculate CPUE and create CPUE timeseries plots
  - determine how CPUE was calculated in the stock assessment
  - review Small Scientific Committee reports and plug notes into Notion

Files created:
  - "figures/NPFC_saury_catch_allcountries.pdf"
    - reported P.saury catch for all countries, includes TAC line
  - "figures/NPFC_catch_allspecies_allcountries.pdf"
    - reported catch for all NPFC priority species from all countries

Files edited:
  - 'NPFC catch data.Rmd'

Brief:
  - plotting funnnnn

Summary:
  - added TAC lines for total area and CA
  - created plots comparing catch between CA and NWs
  - figured out how plot margins and labels work in cowplot() and also theres a lot of cool functionality in cowplot! (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/cowplot/versions/1.1.1)

  - So overall:
    - plots for catch overall, per species
    - plots for comparing CA and NW catch per species
  - plots uploaded to Sharepoint

Breadcrumbs:
  - ***plots for comparing NW v CA catch shifts, one for saury and a plot grid for priority sp
  - ***plots for catch on the high seas CA per species
  - review Small Scientific Committee reports and plug notes into Notion
  - Describe LH, pop dy, stocks, and yearly distribution of Pacific saury

  - 'NPFC catch data.Rmd'

Brief:
  - nice catch plots, and more work to do

Summary:
  - making plots of catch and effort, both total and spatial effort
    - RColorBrewer is v v nice :>
  showed plots to Mark, recommended that I review the stock assessment for some context and try to get a hold of 1950s data
      - "Tt may be good to show domestic catches separately from the Convention area.  I don't know the stock id/dynamics.  Is it all one population that they are fishing?  The CPUE will be interesting."
      - "It is possible that there are only domestic statistics prior to 95 which is likely when the Convention was signed. The high seas landings may be undocumented.  If NPFC has a stock assessment published it should describe this."
    - found Toshihide Iwasaki associated with PICES session

Breadcrumbs:
  - insert TAC line for saury, including total TAC and CA TAC
  - review Small Scientific Committee reports and plug notes into Notion
  - Describe LH, pop dy, stocks, and yearly distribution of Pacific saury
  - email Iwasaki-san about his PICES slides and the dataset he used to plot it
  - spatial catch? NW v CA
  - calculate CPUE

Files created:
  - 'NPFC catch data.Rmd'

Brief:
  - plotting time

Summary:
  - made .rmd file for creating raw catch plots
  - made a theme template
  - played around w RColorBrewer

Breadcrumbs:
  - make plots for squid, mackerel, and sardine
  - calculate CPUE?
  - show plots to Mark for approval

Files created:
  - 'NPFCcatchstats_June102021.csv' [from 'NPFCcatchstats.csv']
  - 'NPFCeffortstats_June102021.csv' [from 'NPFCeffortstats.csv']

Brief:
  - data entry, etc.

Summary:
  - updated catch and effort with Japanese sardine and chub+spotted mackerel

Breadcrumbs:
  - plot out preliminary catch plots
  - summarize status of key species based on grey lit and data into report
  - explore making a GIF of the effort through time (will require a lot of screenshots and Adobe Premiere time...)

Files created:
  - 'NPFCcatchstats.csv'
  - 'NPFCeffortstats.csv'
  - 'spatial effort_NPFC_saury_2019.pdf' + .doc

Brief:
  - data recovery and preliminary viz ideas

Summary:
  - compiled catch and effort data from Pacific saury and squid fisheries from NPFC records into seperate .csvs
  - pulled out the spatial extent of saury fishery in 2019 and put screenshots into plot
    - would be cool to have this be a GIF of some sort?
  - pulled out lots of grey literature and data on NPFC proceedings and Pacific cod stock assessments from RACE, RAMLegacy, etc.

Breadcrumbs:
  - finish compiling data from chub mackerel, sardine, and other NPFC species
  - compile report on saury effort extent based on GIS extension
    - maybe get a hold of the spatial effort data from NPFC?
  - summarize status of key species based on grey lit and data
  - explore making a GIF of the effort through time (will require a lot of screenshots and Adobe Premiere time...)
